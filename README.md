To run the project, please run the main function of Driver class. Before that, you should specify one input and six output folders in your setting. 
To do that, in IntelliJ IDEA, please click "Edit Configurations" under "Run". And then fill the Program arguments for Driver. An example is like: 


                         input output1 output2 output3 output4 output5 output6
